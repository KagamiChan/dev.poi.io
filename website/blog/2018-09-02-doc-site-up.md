With the revolutionary update of poi browser v9.0, we feel that the document should be revised and updated. As a result we've build a separate site to serve developers with beautified contents related to poi's plugin development.

I have to say that we're having a tough time with many unresolved issues from upstream and also from Tanaka's Kancolle Phase II. As almost all active dev members are now employed, only limit effort could be devoted to the project. If you're willing to help, do not hesitate to contact us, any kind of contribution will be appreciated.
